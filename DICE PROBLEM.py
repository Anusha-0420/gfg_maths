You are given a cubic dice with 6 faces. All the individual faces have a number printed on them. The numbers are in the range of 1 to 6, like any ordinary dice. You will be provided with a face of this cube, your task is to guess the number on the opposite face of the cube.
Code: 
class Solution:
    def oppositeFaceOfDice(self, N):
    	#code here 
        return 7-N

if __name__ == '__main__': 
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        N = int(input())
        ob = Solution()
        ans = ob.oppositeFaceOfDice(N)
        print(ans)
Explanation:
1. The Solution class is defined, which presumably contains methods for solving specific problems.
2. The oppositeFaceOfDice method takes two arguments: self (indicating that this method is part of a class) and an integer N.
3. It calculates the value of the opposite face of a dice given the current face value N. The opposite face value is obtained by subtracting N from 7 (since the sum of opposite faces on a standard six-sided die is always 7).
4. The method returns the calculated opposite face value.
5. The code reads an integer t (presumably the number of test cases) and iterates through each test case:
  a) For each test case, it reads an integer N.
  b) An instance of the Solution class is created.
  c) The oppositeFaceOfDice method is called with the input integer N.
  d) The result (the value of the opposite face) is printed for each test case.
