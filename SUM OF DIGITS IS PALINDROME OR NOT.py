Given a number n.Find if the digit sum(or sum of digits) of n is a Palindrome number or not.
Code: 
class Solution:
    def isDigitSumPalindrome(self, n):
        #code here
        n = str(n)
        add = 0
        for i in n:
            add += int(i)
        rev = int(''.join(reversed(str(add))))
        if add == rev:
            return 1
        return 0

if __name__=='__main__':
    t=int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        N=int(input())
        ob=Solution()
        print(ob.isDigitSumPalindrome(N))
      
      explanation: 
1. The Solution class is defined, which presumably contains methods for solving specific problems.
2. The isDigitSumPalindrome method takes two arguments: self (indicating that this method is part of a class) and an integer n.
3. It converts the integer n to a string using str(n).
4. It initializes the variable add to 0.
5. The code iterates through each character in the string representation of n.
6. For each character, it converts it back to an integer using int(i) and adds it to add.
7. The sum of the digits in n is stored in add.
8. The code then reverses the string representation of add using reversed() and joins the characters back together using join().
9. The reversed string is converted back to an integer using int(rev).
10. If the sum of the digits in n equals its reversed value, it returns 1 (indicating that the digit sum is a palindrome).
11. Otherwise, it returns 0.
12. The code reads an integer t (presumably the number of test cases) and iterates through each test case:
  a) For each test case, it reads an integer N.
  b) An instance of the Solution class is created.
  c) The isDigitSumPalindrome method is called with the input integer N.
  d) The result (either 1 or 0) is printed for each test case.
