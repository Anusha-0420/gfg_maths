Given an array arr[] of N integers, calculate the median.
Code:

class Solution:
	def find_median(self, v):
		v.sort()
		l = len(v)
		if l%2 != 0:
		    return v[l//2]
		else:
		    median = v[l//2-1]+v[l//2]
		    output = median//2
		    return output

if __name__ == '__main__':
	T=int(input())
	for i in range(T):
		n = int(input())
		v = list(map(int,input().split())) 
		ob = Solution();
		ans = ob.find_median(v)
		print(ans)
Explanation:
1. The find_median function takes two arguments: self (which suggests that this code might be part of a class) and a list v.
2. It sorts the list v in ascending order using the sort() method.
3. It calculates the length of the sorted list and stores it in the variable l.
4. If the length of the list is odd (i.e., l % 2 != 0),  it returns the middle element (the actual median).
5. If the length of the list is even, it calculates the sum of the two middle elements and divides it by 2 to find the average (approximate median).
6. The code then reads an integer T (presumably the number of test cases) and iterates through each test case.
7. For each test case, it reads an integer n (the size of the list) and a space-separated list of integers.
8. An instance of the Solution class (which is not defined in the provided snippet) is created.
9. The find_median function is called with the input list v, and the result is stored in ans.
10. Finally, the median value for each test case is printed.
  However, there are a few things to note:

  The Solution class is not defined here, so we donâ€™t know its implementation.
  The code assumes that the input format is as described (number of test cases followed by the list size and elements).
  The code does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases (e.g., an empty list).
