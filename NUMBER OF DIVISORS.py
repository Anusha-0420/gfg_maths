Given an integer N, find the number of divisors of N that are divisible by 3.
  Code:

class Solution:
    def count_divisors(self, N):
        c=0
        k=N**0.5
        for i in range(1,int(k)+1):
            if N%i==0:
                if i%3==0:
                    c+=1
                if (N//i)%3==0:
                    c+=1
        if int(k)==k and k%3==0:
            c-=1
        return c


if __name__ == '__main__': 
    t = int (input ())
    for _ in range (t):
        N = int(input())
       

        ob = Solution()
        print(ob.count_divisors(N))
Explanation: 
1. The Solution class is defined, which presumably contains methods for solving specific problems.
2. The count_divisors method takes two arguments: self (indicating that this method is part of a class) and an integer N.
3. It calculates the count of divisors of N that are divisible by 3.
4. The code iterates through the numbers from 1 to the square root of N (inclusive) using range(1, int(k) + 1).
5. For each number i, it checks whether N is divisible by i:
  a) If i is divisible by 3, it increments the count c.
  b) If (N // i) (the other divisor) is divisible by 3, it also increments the count c.
6. If the square root of N is an integer and is divisible by 3, it subtracts 1 from the count c.
7. The method returns the final count of divisors.
8. The code reads an integer t (presumably the number of test cases) and iterates through each test case:
  a) For each test case, it reads an integer N.
  b) An instance of the Solution class is created.
  c) The count_divisors method is called with the input integer N.
  d) The result (the count of divisors) is printed for each test case.
However, there are a few things to note:

The code assumes that the input format is as described (number of test cases followed by the integer values).
It does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases.
